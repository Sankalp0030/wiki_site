# Abhishek



Abhishek is gay, and he never lets this bring him down. He bravely confronts the world to protect and affirm his gayness. Unfortunately, due to his gayness, he was ostracized by his family; his father even chose to invest his hard-earned, lifelong savings in his sisters instead to his only son. He never gave up and kept embracing his gayness and sold himself to earn money. Now his property includes a iPhone 13,a Sony 1000XM4, and a laptop with 24 GB ram but he still calls himself "[poor](/wiki/poor)".
